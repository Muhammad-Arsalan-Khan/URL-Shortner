URL Shortener (EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
Developed a URL Shortener system where users can shorten URLs and track the number of clicks on each shortened link. The backend is built with Express and Node.js, while data is securely stored in MongoDB. The frontend uses EJS to render pages dynamically and provide an intuitive user interface for managing shortened URLs and click statistics.
